### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I have been creating user interfaces on React since 2015.
At this time, I worked for small and large companies and also was a co-founder of the startup. 

I have over 5 years of commercial web-development experience (wow!) ðŸ‘€

âš¡ I really love creating layouts
âš¡ I solve problems, not playing programming
âš¡ In my free time I like to play on my PS4 (yes, I'm geek)
